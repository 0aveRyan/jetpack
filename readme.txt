== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need a WordPress.com account to connect to Jetpack? =

Many of our features leverage the WordPress.com cloud, like Photon and Stats.  WordPress.com needs to be able to communicate with your site in order to serve it! If you donâ€™t have a WordPress.com account already, you can create one during the connection process, or set one up for free at wordpress.com/start/account/user. Setup is an easy, 30-second process. 

= Is Jetpack Free? =

Yes! The core features of Jetpack are and always will be free.  There are a couple features not tied direclty with core Jetpack are paid, like VaultPress and Akismet.  

= I already have a WordPress account, but it's not working, what's going on? =

Jetpack requires a connection to [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) to enable all features. This is a different account than the one you use to log into your self-hosted WordPress. If you can log into http://wordpress.com, then you already have a WordPress.com account. If you can't, then you can easily create one as part of the installation of Jetpack.

= How do I view my stats? =

Once you've installed Jetpack, your stats will be available via the "Site Stats" menu which appears in the new Jetpack menu (under your Dashboard menu within WordPress).

= How do I contribute to Jetpack? =

Easy! There are opportunities for developers at all levels to contribute:

* Join our Beta Test group.
* Give us a hand answering questions in our [support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/jetpack).
* Report bugs, with reproduction steps, or post patches on [GitHub](https://github.com/Automattic/Jetpack).
