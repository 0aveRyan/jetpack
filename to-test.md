### Contact forms

This version ships a new interface to build and edit contact forms.
- edit or add a new post, check that the button to add the form look fine, both desktop and mobile
- try different browsers (there's a known FF issue that causes it to lose the content but will be fixed soon)
- add a new form and edit it in many ways.

### Welcome page

You should be getting a new welcome full page displayed with this release. Make sure it can be dismissed and shows up only once.

### New Jumpstart

New installations will get a new Jumpstart full page showcasing and explaining them. It should work properly and activate the said features.
To test, scroll down to the bottom of the Jetpack Settings page and click `Reset Options (dev only)`. Jumpstart should show up now.

### Comment likes

Its code, mainly in front end, was streamlined and reduced. Make sure everything works great.
