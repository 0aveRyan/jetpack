## Contributing for Everyone!

Whether you can barely recognize a filter (or don’t know what that means) or you’ve already authored your own plugins, there are ways for you to pitch in.

### Beta Testing

Beta testers give updates, fixes, and new modules a test run before they’re publicly released, so they’re an important part of the development process. If you'd like to join our Beta group, [contact us](http://jetpack.me/contact-support/)!
